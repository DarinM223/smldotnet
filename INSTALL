INSTALLING SML.NET
------------------

These instructions are the absolute minimum for setting up SML.NET
from binaries. Requirements:

* Microsoft.NET Framework Redist or SDK.

Unpack the distribution. Then:

(1) (On Windows 98 or ME) Set SMLNETPATH to the compiler directory
(e.g. C:\smlnet) 

(2) (Optional) Extend your path with the compiler binaries directory
(e.g. C:\smlnet\bin) 

That's it!

The "smlnet" (ie. C:\smlnet\bin\smlnet.bat) command starts up the
compiler. Test the compiler from the smlnet directory by entering the
following commands from within the compilation environment:
  
source demos\sort
export Sort
make 
run
