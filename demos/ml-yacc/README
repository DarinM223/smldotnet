This is an SML.NET version of ML-Yacc.

The following files from the NJ distribution have been removed:
   INSTALL
   build

The following directory has been moved
   lib                now in %SMLNETPATH%\lib\parsing for general use

The following files have been added:
   build.bat          batch file which calls SML.NET on the following
   ml-yacc.smlnet     SML.NET script which builds ml-yacc.exe
   src\sources.smlnet SML.NET script setting up entity-file mappings

The following file has been modified:
   src\export-yacc.sml main function added and NJ-specific interrupt 
                       handling crudely commented out

The source for the examples is included, but has not yet been
"SML.NETified", so you'll need to do some (very minor) work to build
them. We'll add build scripts for these shortly.
